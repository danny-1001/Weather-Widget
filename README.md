# Weather-Widget
Improved version of weather widget assignment

#Technologies used:
-HTML5
-Bootstrap
-SCSS / CSS
-JavaScript
-jQuery

#Implementation:
-I used HTML to form the layout of the weather widget app like
where the api information was going to be displayed and in what containers.

-I used Bootstrap to give the layout columns and rows as well as styling 
certain elements of the submit button.

-I used SCSS for most of the visual styles as well as adding media queries for
better responsiveness. 

-I used JavaScript and jQuery to fetch the Weather Map api data and display it in the 
container

#What I learned:
Although it might seem obvious and after a few minutes of struggling, I learned that the jQuery script has to go first/above 
the javascript file that is fetching the data.
